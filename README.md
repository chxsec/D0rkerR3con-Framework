  <em>"What They Forgot to Hide, We’re Meant to Find"</em>
</p>


---

**D0rkerR3con** is a fast, offline Google Dorking toolkit that provides an interactive terminal interface (built with `gum`) for structured discovery of exposed targets.

Created by **Chris "SaintDruG" Abou‑Chabké** from **Black Hat Ethical Hacking**.

## Who Is It For?

- Red Teams  
- Pentesters  
- Advanced Offensive Operators  
- Bug Bounty Hunters  
- Security Engineers  

Use this framework to **quickly execute categorized Google dorks**, review saved results, and organize recon findings without relying on external tools or web GUIs.

## Outlaw Inspiration from RDR 2

This project is inspired by **Arthur Morgan** — the legendary outlaw from *Red Dead Redemption 2*. A man of few words but sharp instincts, Arthur wasn't just a gun-for-hire — he was a **watchful tactician**, someone who **read his enemies, moved in silence**, and acted only when it mattered.

**D0rkerR3con** reflects that same spirit:

- **Google Dorks** = your long-range rifle — precise, silent, deadly  
- **Search Engine Recon** = scouting from the hills, seeing without being seen  
- **Targets** = corporate fortresses hiding secrets in plain sight  
- **You** = the one who rides in with nothing but grit, wit, and a mission

> *"We can't change what's done, we can only move on."*  
> — Arthur Morgan

This tool wasn’t made for noise, but stealth in its core. It was made for **operators**, **watchers**, **digital outlaws** who understand the value of good Recon and **quiet power**. Built not for fame — but to get the job done.

## Description

**D0rkerR3con Framework** automates structured Google Dork-based reconnaissance by leveraging a local, categorized database of over 68 high-impact dorks.

Each dork is categorized (e.g., Admin Panels, Exposed Files, Credentials, Debug Info, Secrets, etc.) and presented to the user via an interactive terminal UI powered by `gum`, allowing for quick multi-selection, clean execution, and full result organization per target domain.

The tool executes live Google searches in the default browser and cleanly stores each result for auditing, reporting, or re-use.

## The Flow Behind It

> The tool is fully modular. Each scan creates structured folders under `results/`, organized by domain.

### 1. **Domain-Based Scanning**

- You input a **target domain** (e.g., `example.com`)
- A clean directory is created at: `results/example.com/`
- All scan data is saved per session

---

### 2. **Dork Selection via Gum UI**

- Categories are presented in a scrollable, colorful Gum-based menu
- You select from:
  - Specific categories (e.g., Secrets, Cloud Buckets)
  - `Show All` to view all dorks (68+)
- Multi-selection is supported
- Each dork has:
  - Title (for clarity)
  - Category (for grouping)
  - The raw Google Dork query

---

### 3. **Live Execution in Browser**

- Selected dorks are executed in your default browser
- Google search opens with `site:example.com` + the selected dork
- All URLs are saved locally

Files created:

```
results/example.com/
├── dorks_used.txt           # Dorks run, with titles
├── raw_results.txt          # All discovered links
└── export_example.com.html  # (Optional) Pretty report
```

---

### 4. **Optional HTML Report Generation**

- After the scan, you're asked if you want to export to HTML
- If yes, a clean `export_example.com.html` is created with:
  - Domain name
  - Scan date
  - Dorks used with titles
  - All discovered URLs
  - Framework credits

---

### 5. **Revisiting Old Scans**

- From the main menu, you can select `View Previous Results`
- Pick any domain from the `results/` directory
- View the TXT output in terminal
- Re-export it into HTML if needed

---

You can also extend the database by editing `dorkdb.json`, adding your own titles, categories, and dork strings.

> No APIs. No rate limits. No noise. Just clean, focused, high-signal recon.

## I love GUM why?

Well a picture is worth a thousand words ain't it?

The tool uses [**GUM**](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for its interactive and vibrant terminal UI, bringing a lively, colorful experience to recon workflows.

## Future Plans: GUI Edition

I am planning to build a cross-platform GUI version of **D0rkerR3con** using:

- **Vite + Svelte** for the frontend
- **TailwindCSS** for the visual style (matching the neon/pink terminal look)
- Local bridge/API to access dorkdb.json and results
- Offline-first with an interactive dork launcher, viewer, and HTML exporter

The GUI will mirror the terminal workflow, adding clarity and accessibility for visual Recon OPS and future users.
